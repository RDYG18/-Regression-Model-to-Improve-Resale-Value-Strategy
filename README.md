Company context 

ReCell is a startup aiming to tap into the rapidly growing market of refurbished and used mobile devices by leveraging the power of data science. The company seeks to develop a dynamic pricing strategy that optimizes resale prices, identifies the key factors that influence device value, and maximizes revenueâ€”all while offering competitive prices to customers and promoting sustainable consumption.

This focus aligns with broader market trends: the refurbished and used device segment has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by consumer demand for affordable alternatives, increasing environmental awareness, and support from third-party platforms such as Amazon and Verizon. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC), this market was projected to reach $52.7 billion by 2023, with a compound annual growth rate of 13.6% between 2018 and 2023. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated this shift, pushing consumers toward more practical and cost-efficient buying decisions.

Objective 

 This project builds a linear regression model to predict resale prices of used and refurbished phones and tablets, identifying the key features that influence value.
