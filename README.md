## Company Context

<div align="justify">

In this project, I collaborated with ReCell, a startup aiming to capture value in the rapidly growing market of refurbished and used mobile devices. Recognizing a shift in consumer behavior and a clear market opportunity, the company is leveraging data science to build a dynamic pricing strategy that accurately predicts resale value, identifies the key features influencing pricing, and ultimately maximizes revenue while remaining competitive and promoting sustainable consumption.

ReCell’s strategy is grounded in larger industry trends. The refurbished device market has experienced substantial growth in recent years, driven by increasing demand for affordable alternatives, rising environmental awareness, and strong support from third-party platforms like Amazon and Verizon. According to IDC, the market was projected to reach $52.7 billion by 2023, with a CAGR of 13.6% between 2018 and 2023. The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated this momentum, as consumers turned toward more practical and sustainable tech solutions.
