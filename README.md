## Company Context

<div align="justify">

In this project, I collaborated with ReCell, a startup aiming to capture value in the rapidly growing market of refurbished and used mobile devices. Recognizing a shift in consumer behavior and a clear market opportunity, the company is leveraging data science to build a dynamic pricing strategy that accurately predicts resale value, identifies the key features influencing pricing, and ultimately maximizes revenue while remaining competitive and promoting sustainable consumption.

ReCellâ€™s strategy is grounded in larger industry trends. The refurbished device market has experienced substantial growth in recent years, driven by increasing demand for affordable alternatives, rising environmental awareness, and strong support from third-party platforms like Amazon and Verizon. According to IDC, the market was projected to reach $52.7 billion by 2023, with a CAGR of 13.6% between 2018 and 2023. The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated this momentum, as consumers turned toward more practical and sustainable tech solutions.

## ðŸ“‚Dataset

### Dataset Overview
The original dataset contained 3,454 rows and 15 columns. An additional 5,000 synthetic rows were generated to simulate a larger dataset for modeling and analytical purposes, resulting in a total of 8,454 observations with the same structure.

#### Device specs:
Device Specifications:
brand_name, os, screen_size, main_camera_mp, selfie_camera_mp, int_memory, ram, battery, weight, 4g, 5g

#### Usage & Pricing Data:
release_year, days_used, normalized_new_price, normalized_used_price

### ðŸ“ŒNotes: 
The target variable is **normalized_used_price**, representing the resale price normalized across brands/models.

#### Missing Values:
To simulate real world data imperfections, a proportion of missing values was intentionally introduced in the synthetic portion of the dataset. These missing values follow the same patterns and frequencies as those found in the original data.

main_camera_mp: 438 missing

selfie_camera_mp: 4 missing

int_memory: 9 missing

ram: 9 missing

battery: 14 missing

weight: 17 missing

**Note on Data Augmentation:**
Synthetic rows were generated to simulate a larger dataset for educational purposes.
This expansion helps apply more advanced modeling techniques and demonstrate scalability, model behavior, and data interpretation, while preserving the original data structure and missing value patterns.
