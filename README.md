Company context 

The refurbished and used mobile device market has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by consumer demand for affordable alternatives, increasing environmental awareness, and support from third-party platforms like Amazon and Verizon. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC), this market was projected to reach $52.7 billion by 2023, with a 13.6% compound annual growth rate from 2018 to 2023. These trends are also fueled by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which shifted consumer priorities toward practicality and cost-efficiency.ReCell, a startup aiming to tap into this rapidly expanding segment, is focused on developing a dynamic pricing strategy using data science. By leveraging historical device data and predictive modeling, ReCell seeks to optimize resale prices, identify key factors that influence device value, and ultimately maximize revenue while offering competitive pricing to customers. 

Objective 

 This project builds a linear regression model to predict resale prices of used and refurbished phones and tablets, identifying the key features that influence value.
